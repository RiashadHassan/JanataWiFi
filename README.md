### My experience(problems & learnings)

### Exploring File Handling in Python:
In the initial stages of this project, my exposure to file handling in Python was quite limited. A significant portion of the allocated time was dedicated to researching and comprehending how to effectively manage the provided JSON file.
I spent a large amount of the given time researching and figuring out how to work with the provided JSON file and how to import the data from the Json file and populate the SQL Table instances with said imported data, but after scrupulous research I figured it out.
### Venturing into Visual Graphs with Plotly Express:
I had absolutely no previous experience with Visual Graphs from SQL tables before this project, except for very primary Machine Learning projects that we had to complete for Uni courses.
I found out about Plotly Express and did some research on it and used that to build the charts as best as I could.

### Challenges I Faced:
Unfortunately I don't have enough time to do in-detail research on dropdown menues in plotly because I am pretty much out of time to submit this within the given deadline
And as for deploying the server, unfortunately Vercel does not accept SQLite (which is what i used in the project) and PythonAnywhere is limited to Python 3.10 wheresas I use 3.11.

### Final Words:
Regardless of If I get picked for the internship role or not, I would like to thank the JanataWiFi software team for coming up with such a fantastic test project.
This has helped me learn new things, about which i had no prior knowledge. 
And as someone who does not have any prior Industry Experience the main problem i face when programming is that i don't know what i don't know
Given a problem I can go and learn it within a very short period of time.
